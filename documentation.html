<h1>Documentation - UltimateKEYS Keyboard Layout</h1>

<p>International US QWERTY layout with AltGr (Right Alt) dead keys via AutoHotkey script (Win), MSKLC source (Win) and XKB integration (Linux).<br />
<a href="https://github.com/pieter-degroote/UltimateKEYS/releases" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/release/pieter-degroote/UltimateKEYS.svg" alt="GitHub Release" /></a></p>

<p>In UltimateKEYS, all keys remain exactly organized as US QWERTY. Except, when <em>AltGr (Right Alt)</em> or <em>AltGr+Shift (Right Alt + Shift)</em> is pressed in combination with another key, other diacritics and symbols are accessible and some keys become dead keys.</p>

<p>In that way, it is - somehow - similar to the layout "United States-International" (on Windows), although this project moves all dead key combinations to the modifiers <em>AltGr</em> and <em>AltGr+Shift</em>. That way, this project solves the most typical issues, among which the quotes (' and ") can be used as usual (without pressing the spacebar afterwards), while the acute accent (&#x00b4;) and diaeresis (&#x00a8;) are found on <em>AltGr+'</em> and <em>AltGr+Shift+"</em> respectively. This project has borrowed several aspects from the EurKEY Keyboard Layout (by Steffen Br&uuml;ntjen).</p>

<h2>Difference between Classic edition and SW edition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Classic : &nbsp;Keeps all standard keys on US QWERTY and adds customizations to the <em>Right Alt (+Shift)</em> modifier.</li>
<li>SW (switched) : &nbsp;Also adds customizations to the <em>Right Alt (+Shift)</em> modifier, but also makes the symbols !, @, #, $, %, ^, &amp;, *, ( and ) accessible without holding down Shift. The numbers have moved to Shift (as most computers have a separate numpad).</li>
</ul>
