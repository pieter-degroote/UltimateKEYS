<h1>History of UltimateKEYS and Changes from EurKEY (transcript)</h1>

<p>UltimateKEYS and EurKEY are similar projects, whereas UltimateKEYS has borrowed some aspects from the <a href="https://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/" target="_blank">EurKEY Keyboard Layout</a> (by Steffen Brüntjen, GPL v3).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Some of the changes concerning the sources include&nbsp;:</strong></p>

<p>AutoHotkey&nbsp;: &nbsp;a new kind of script to achieve the same functions as with MSLKC, all keys and dead key combinations (etc.) have been ‘well-documented’ in the comments. :)</p>

<p>MSKLC&nbsp;: &nbsp;another implementation, now also with comments for all keys.</p>

<p>Linux&nbsp;: &nbsp;as for now, these versions should have the same functionality as on Windows.<br />
Two implementations are supported&nbsp;: &nbsp;xkb (xkeyboard-config) and Xmodmap.<br />
The dead key descriptions are applied via "~/.XCompose" (see also: <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/XCompose" target="_blank">https://wiki.debian.org/XCompose</a>).</p>

<p>Keyboard layout images&nbsp;: &nbsp;<a href="layout-generator-urls.html" target="_blank">sources available on keyboard-layout-editor.com</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Latest Changes to the Layout</h2>

<p>The latest version features an advanced ‘Compose key’ (Multi_key) function. This multi-purpose dead key has been put on the top left position of the layout (see <em>AltGr + ‘grave/tilde’</em>)</p>

<p>This new Linux-like ‘Compose key’ allows for typing even a wider amount of diacritics and symbols, each with two additional keystrokes.<br />
This move has put some accented letters and symbols on other, and hopefully, more favo[u]rable positions than before.</p>

<p>Thay way, the whole keyboard layout has made, somehow, a metamorphosis, making more room for other spacing characters, general punctuation and math symbols.</p>

<p>Instructions for the SW (or switched) variants can now be found in the ‘testing’ repository, provided with the needed scripts and/or further explanation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Changes from UltimateKEYS Legacy</h2>

<p>The letters ‘ð/Ð’ (eth), ‘þ/Þ’ (thorn), ‘ý/Ý’, ‘ÿ/Ÿ’ and symbol ‘†/‡’ have now been substituted with more widely used letters with a circumflex (for French, Portuguese...).<br />
Eth and thorn got their place now on the dead key ‘AltGr+`’, followed by ‘d/D’ and ‘t/T’ respectively.<br />
The dagger (†) and double dagger (‡) have now moved to ‘AltGr+\’, followed by ‘d/D’.</p>

<p>The dead keys on ‘AltGr+(Shift+)-’ (cedilla/ogonek and breve/special) have now moved to ‘AltGr+(Shift+)8’.

<p>The letters with tilde ‘ã/Ã’ and ‘õ/Õ’ now got their places, next to each other, on ‘AltGr+(Shift+)-’ and ‘AltGr+(Shift+)=’ respectively.</p>

<p>That way, the substituted symbols („ , ¶ , × , ÷) have now all been added to the dead key ‘AltGr+\’.</p>

<p>The capital Eszett (ẞ) got its place back on the main layout (AltGr+Shift+S), as the uppercase form of Eszett (ß). The section sign (§) has moved to ‘AltGr+3’.</p>

<p>Further on, some accented letters directly available on the main layout have been removed from their corresponding dead keys.<br />
That way, some other letters (like ő/Ő and ű/Ű for Hungarian, etc.) got more favo[u]red places on their corresponding dead keys instead.<br />
The corresponding keyboard layout images have been updated accordingly.</p>

<p>As for now, both Windows and Linux implementations should work in the same way (identical layout image and identical dead key descriptions).</p>

<p>Due to the more difficult nature of ‘keyboard-layout-editor.com’ to allow ‘combining accents’, I had to use some special techniques and maneuvers [manoeuvres] using the ‘narrow no-break space’ (u+202f) both before <em>and</em> after each ‘combining accent’.</p>

<p>Making matters somewhat more complicated, it turns out that the layout editor automatically removes all trailing (and leading) spaces, also those special space characters, too...<br />
Finally, I managed to puzzle with the generated code directly, making everything looked right on the screen. As downloading the images (as PNG) messed them up again, the only workaround was making a snapshot and saving the cut-out layout as PNG. - Finally&nbsp;!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>UltimateKEYS Legacy versus EurKEY - Changes</h2>

<p>The math symbols have been fixed again&nbsp;!! (This feature was broken in EurKEY 1.3 beta for Windows, see AltGr+Shift+M.)

<p>Moved the ligature œ/Œ to AltGr+(Shift+)K (corresponds with existing Linux implementations).</p>

<p>Moved the ligature ij/IJ (ĳ/Ĳ) to the dead key AltGr+' (or AltGr+Shift+_), followed by ‘j/J’ (normally <em>always</em> two separate characters in Dutch/Flemish, as Dutch (Flemish) is my mother tongue).</p>

<p>Avoid confusion with signs similar to the degree sign (°)&nbsp;: &nbsp;removed ‘empty ring above’
and put masculine (º) and feminine (ª) ordinal indicator to dead key (AltGr+\) (º and ª are only applicable for Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Galician).</p>

<p>Added copyright sign (©) to AltGr+2, instead of ª.</p>

<p>Added plus-minus sign (±) to AltGr+3, instead of º (no confusion with degree sign anymore... ;) ).</p>

<p>AltGr+7, followed by ‘space’ (or not allowed character in MSKLC implementation)&nbsp;: &nbsp;produces ‘empty dot above’ (˙) (no confusion with degree sign either).</p>

<p>The letter ‘eth’ (ð/Ð) has been put back, accompanying ‘thorn’ (þ/Þ) on the layout...<br />
Indeed, the languages Icelandic, Faroese (and Elfdalian) are not that widely used/spoken, but that’s a ‘different something’ for the future...<br />
=&gt; <em>This has changed in the new version&nbsp;: &nbsp;those letters have now been substituted with ‘more widely used ones’.</em></p>

<p>Added back the dagger (†), plus double dagger (‡) to the layout (AltGr+(Shift+)P).</p>

<p>Added a separate dead key for ‘cedilla/ogonek’ and ‘breve/special’ (AltGr+(Shift+)-).</p>

<p>The pilcrow sign (¶) also got a place on the main layout (AltGr+Shift+8), as the ‘single low-9 quotation mark’ (‚) is rather rarely used... and is thus put on a dead key combination (AltGr+\ then ‘q/Q’).</p>

<p>The capital Eszett (ẞ) got its place on the dead key AltGr+' (or AltGr+Shift+_), followed by ‘ß’ (AltGr+s).<br />
The section sign (§) got its place back on ‘AltGr+Shift+S’.</p>

<p>Added support for the Hungarian letters ő/Ő and ű/Ű via AltGr+', followed by ‘ö/Ö’ or ‘ü/Ü’.</p>


<p>Another tweak&nbsp;: &nbsp;recent releases also feature “Smart error-tolerant optimization for circumflex in French”, allowing you to type the letters â, ê, î, ô, û more easily (for AHK, MSKLC and Linux).</p>

<p>Plus lots of other changes and/or improvements... ;)</p>

<p>The legacy version can now be found at&nbsp;: &nbsp;<a href="https://pieter-degroote.github.io/UltimateKEYS-legacy/" target="_blank"><strong>UltimateKEYS - Legacy Website</strong></a>&emsp;<a href="https://github.com/pieter-degroote/UltimateKEYS-legacy/releases" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/release/pieter-degroote/UltimateKEYS-legacy.svg?label=legacy" alt="GitHub Legacy" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Important - Security Warning</h2>

<p><strong>=&gt; Win/Linux&nbsp;: &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Only use “BASIC LATIN” characters (codes 32 to 126) for your Windows, Microsoft Live and Linux passwords&nbsp;!</span></strong><br />
Otherwise, it might be impossible to type any Unicode character higher than “Basic Latin” at the login screen/prompt (due to a different keyboard configuration)&nbsp;!&emsp;<strong>=&gt;&emsp;ACCOUNT LOCKOUT<br />
=&gt; Win/Linux&nbsp;: &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALWAYS make your system passwords VISIBLE during modification&nbsp;!</span></strong></p>
