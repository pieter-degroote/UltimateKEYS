<h1>UltimateKEYS Keyboard Layout (Windows)</h1>

<p>This project is based on US-QWERTY and is forked from the EurKEY Keyboard Layout.</p>

<p>In UltimateKEYS, all keys are exactly organized as US-QWERTY. When AltGr or AltGr+Shift is pressed in combination with another key, other diacritics and symbols are accessible and some keys become dead keys.</p>

<p>In that way, it is - somehow - similar to the layout "United States-International" (on Windows), although this project moves all dead key combinations to the modifiers AltGr and AltGr+Shift. That way, this project solves the most typical caveats, among which the quotes (' and ") can be used as usual (without pressing the spacebar afterwards), while the acute accent (&#x00b4;) and diaeresis (&#x00a8;) are found under Alt and Alt+Shift respectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Script for AutoHotkey</h2>

<p>This AutoHotkey script is a highly customizable version of UltimateKEYS. To work properly, the Windows keyboard has to be set to standard US-QWERTY and at least AutoHotkey 1.1 (AutoHotkey_L) is required.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>AutoHotkey website : &nbsp;<a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/" target="_blank">https://www.autohotkey.com/</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Download the 'UltimateKEYS - YYYY-MM-DD.ahk' file from this repository.</strong></li>
<li><strong>After AutoHotkey is installed, you can optionally put the AHK file in the 'Startup' folder.</strong></li>
