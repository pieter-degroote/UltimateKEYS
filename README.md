## Script for AutoHotkey

In case you prefer this approach, there is also a highly customizable AutoHotkey script available. To work properly, the Windows keyboard has to be set to standard US-QWERTY and at least AutoHotkey 1.1 (AutoHotkey_L) is required.

- **Download the 'UltimateKEYS - YYYY-MM-DD.ahk' file from this repository.**
- **After AutoHotkey is installed, you can optionally put the AHK file in the 'Startup' folder.**

## Tools for opening and handling KLC files
