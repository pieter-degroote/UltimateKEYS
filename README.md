### Installing UltimateKEYS :


In case you have already installed a previous version of UltimateKEYS, you need to perform the following steps (otherwise, start with step 4) :

1. Remove it from the 'language bar'.
2. Uninstall it via 'Control Panel' -> 'Programs and Features'.
3. Restart your computer.
4. Unpack the ZIP file and run 'setup.exe'.
5. Confirm the UAC (User Account Control) prompt by clicking 'Yes'.
6. Log off and back on.
7. Optionally, enable UltimateKEYS as the preferred keyboard layout in the 'language bar'.


### Important - Please note :

- **The current version(s) should be sufficiently stable and reliable for everyday use, but are _NOT_ certified for mission-critical systems !**
