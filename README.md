# UltimateKEYS Keyboard Layout (Windows)
International US QWERTY layout with AltGr dead keys via AutoHotkey script and MSKLC source.

In UltimateKEYS, all keys remain exactly organized as US QWERTY. Except, when `AltGr` or `AltGr+Shift` is pressed in combination with another key, other diacritics and symbols are accessible and some keys become dead keys.

In that way, it is - somehow - similar to the layout "United States-International" (on Windows), although this project moves all dead key combinations to the modifiers `AltGr` and `AltGr+Shift`. That way, this project solves the most typical issues, among which the quotes (' and ") can be used as usual (without pressing the spacebar afterwards), while the acute accent (&#x00b4;) and diaeresis (&#x00a8;) are found on `AltGr+'` and `AltGr+Shift+"` respectively. This project has borrowed several aspects from the EurKEY Keyboard Layout (by Steffen Br&uuml;ntjen).

## Script for AutoHotkey

This AutoHotkey script is a highly customizable version of UltimateKEYS. To work properly, the Windows keyboard has to be set to standard US QWERTY and at least AutoHotkey v1.1 (preferably as 'Unicode 64-bit', on 32-bit Windows as 'Unicode 32-bit') is required.

- **AutoHotkey website : &nbsp;https://www.autohotkey.com/**
- **Install the latest release of the current v1.1 branch (preferably as 'Unicode 64-bit', on 32-bit Windows as 'Unicode 32-bit').**
- **Download (and run) the 'UltimateKEYS - YYYY-MM-DD.ahk' file from this repository.**
- **Optionally, you can put the AHK file in the 'Startup' folder to launch at startup.**
- **Please note : &nbsp;this is an overlay script, specifically designed for the keyboard layout 'US QWERTY'.**
