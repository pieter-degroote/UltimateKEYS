#### Documentation (about EurKEY 1.3 [beta], 2017) :

- **https://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/download/windows/1.3/eurkey-layout-complete.pdf**

**For UltimateKEYS, the majority (99%) of the documentation is the same. In UltimateKEYS, the math symbols have been fixed. Furthermore, some additions/changes have been made to support even more letters and symbols, mostly under combinations with the dead keys.**
