# UltimateKEYS Keyboard Layout (Windows/Linux)
International US QWERTY layout with AltGr (Right Alt) dead keys via AutoHotkey script (Win), MSKLC source (Win) and XKB integration (Linux).

In UltimateKEYS, all keys remain exactly organized as US QWERTY. Except, when `AltGr` (`Right Alt`) or `AltGr+Shift` (`Right Alt + Shift`) is pressed in combination with another key, other diacritics and symbols are accessible and some keys become dead keys.

In that way, it is - somehow - similar to the layout "United States-International" (on Windows), although this project moves all dead key combinations to the modifiers `AltGr` and `AltGr+Shift`. That way, this project solves the most typical issues, among which the quotes (' and ") can be used as usual (without pressing the spacebar afterwards), while the acute accent (&#x00b4;) and diaeresis (&#x00a8;) are found on `AltGr+'` and `AltGr+Shift+"` respectively. This project has borrowed several aspects from the EurKEY Keyboard Layout (by Steffen Br&uuml;ntjen).

## Difference between classic edition and SW edition

Classic : &nbsp;Keeps all standard keys on US QWERTY and adds customizations via the `Right Alt (+Shift)` modifier.

SW (switched) edition : &nbsp;Adds customizations via the `Right Alt (+Shift)` modifier, but makes the symbols !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, \*, ( and ) accessible without holding down Shift. The numbers have moved to Shift (as most computers also have a separate numpad).

## Script for AutoHotkey (Windows)

This AutoHotkey script is a highly customizable version of UltimateKEYS. To work properly, the Windows keyboard has to be set to standard US QWERTY and at least AutoHotkey v1.1 (preferably as 'Unicode 64-bit', on 32-bit Windows as 'Unicode 32-bit') is required.

- **AutoHotkey website : &nbsp;https://www.autohotkey.com/ / https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L/releases**
- **Install the latest release of the current v1.1 branch (preferably as 'Unicode 64-bit', on 32-bit Windows as 'Unicode 32-bit').**
- **Download (and run) the "UltimateKEYS \[SW\] - YYYY-MM-DD.ahk" file from this repository.**
- **Optionally, you can put the AHK file in the 'Startup' folder to launch at startup.**
- **Please note : &nbsp;this is an overlay script, specifically designed for the keyboard layout 'US QWERTY'.**

## MSKLC integration (Windows)

Two MSKLC source files are available for integration on Windows OSes (although not recommended on Windows 10 and/or in a production environment).

## XKB integration (Linux)

Experimental support for GNU/Linux via XKB integration (X11) : &nbsp;see the 'linux-xkb' folder in this repository.

Follow these steps for experimental integration (at your own risk!) :

- Download the files `ultkeys[-sw]` and `rule[-sw].xml` from the 'linux-xkb' folder.
- Copy `ultkeys[-sw]` to `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols` (root required).
- Paste the contents of `rule[-sw].xml` to either `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml` or `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.extras.xml`, this between the tags `<layoutList>` and `</layoutList>` (root required).

## Enjoy and have fun ! &nbsp;- &nbsp;Veel plezier ! &nbsp;â˜º
