# UltimateKEYS Keyboard Layout (Windows)
This project is a fork based on the EurKEY Keyboard Layout.

### Download the latest version here :

- **https://github.com/pieter-degroote/UltimateKEYS/raw/master/UltimateKEYS%20-%202019-04-16.zip**


### Please note :

- **In case you have installed a previous version of UltimateKEYS, you need to uninstall it before, followed by restarting your computer. Then you can continue installing another version.**

- **The current version(s) should be sufficiently stable and reliable for everyday use, but are NOT certified for mission-critical systems !**


### Documentation :

#### Additional documentation (about EurKEY 1.3 [beta], 2017) :

- **https://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/download/windows/1.3/eurkey-layout-complete.pdf**
- EurKEY website (by Steffen Br√ºntjen) :  https://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/

**For UltimateKEYS, the majority (99%) of the documentation is the same. In UltimateKEYS, the math symbols have been restored. Furthermore, some additions/changes have been made to support even more letters and symbols, mostly concerning dead key combinations.**


### Another handy tool for handling '.KLC' files (found in the 'source' folder in the UltimateKEYS package) :
