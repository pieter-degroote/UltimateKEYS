# UltimateKEYS for AutoHotkey v1.1

Prerequisite&nbsp;:

The base keyboard layout has to be configured as US QWERTY.

When two or more languages/keyboards are installed on the system, the default 'Alt + Shift' sequence will interfere with the AHK scripts.

To avoid this, you can disable the interfering key sequences at&nbsp;:

*Settings -&gt; Time &amp; Language -&gt; Language -&gt; Spelling, typing &amp; keyboard settings (on the right) -&gt; Advanced keyboard settings -&gt; Input language hot keys*

Please note that on the standard US QWERTY, the sequence 'Left Alt + Shift' also gets mistakenly triggered by 'Right Alt + Shift', resulting in an unexpected keyboard layout change...
