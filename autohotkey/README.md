# UltimateKEYS for AutoHotkey v2/v1.1

## Prerequisites

These AutoHotkey scripts are highly customizable editions of UltimateKEYS. To work properly, the Windows main/base keyboard layout has to be set to&nbsp;:

**=&gt; AltGr assigned to UltimateKEYS**

- [US QWERTY (Euro)](https://github.com/pieter-degroote/us-qwerty-euro)
- [US Intl AltGr dead keys](https://github.com/pieter-degroote/us-intl-altgr-dk)
- [UltimateKEYS (MSKLC implementation)](https://pieter-degroote.github.io/UltimateKEYS/integration-msklc.html)
- Hausa (Latin, Nigeria) (based on US QWERTY, see settings)
- Romanian (Programmers) (based on US QWERTY, see settings)
- English (India) (based on US QWERTY, see settings)
- or any other layout that is fully based on US QWERTY

**=&gt; Right Alt assigned to UltimateKEYS (secondary choice)**

- United States (US)

Notes&nbsp;: &nbsp;"Romanian (Programmers)" does not contain some special control codes (Ctrl+\[: u+001b, Ctrl+\\: u+001c, Ctrl+\]: u+001d), but I could not find any specific use cases requiring these mappings. "English (India)" also emits an Indian rupee sign (₹) via Ctrl+Shift+4.

**_Note about the standard base US layout&nbsp;:_**

When two or more languages/keyboards are installed on the system, the default 'Alt + Shift' sequence will interfere with the AHK scripts.  
To avoid this, you can disable the interfering key sequences at&nbsp;:  
*Settings -&gt; Time &amp; Language -&gt; Language -&gt; Spelling, typing &amp; keyboard settings (on the right) -&gt; Advanced keyboard settings -&gt; Input language hot keys*  
Please note that on the standard US QWERTY, the sequence 'Left Alt + Shift' also gets mistakenly triggered by 'Right Alt + Shift', resulting in an unexpected keyboard layout change.
